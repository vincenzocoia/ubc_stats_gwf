Subject: Starting a new tradition - Thesis writing workshops for Statistics graduate students

Dear all,

We (Estella, Vincenzo and I) are planning to start a new tradition in our department by running one workshop on thesis writing per term. The topic of a workshop should be related to writing using the "integrated" language of math and language. Examples of topics are math notation, writing abstracts, or technical report writing. In the workshop, students will be expected to exchange a small piece of their work with peers so that they can give and receive feedback using rubric provided by faculty. Faculty will also be invited to speak about the topic and participate in the student feedback discussion.  

As pointed out by Nancy, helping graduate students develop good writing skills is something the department has struggled for a long time like decades. This is also something other universities also struggle. We hope we can push this tradition forward and make a change (even a little) to our graduate program. Several faculty has already expressed willingness to participate, and we are confident that many other faculty would be happy to do so.

We would like to recruit two to three more people to help us planning and running the workshop next term. Currently we have one on board. Please let us know if you are interested by Friday, Nov 28. We will be having a meeting in mid-December to outline our first workshop next term. 

We have also created a blog at: https://blogs.ubc.ca/statisticsgwf/ to exchange our thoughts on thesis writing. We will also be using the blog to post the details about the workshop. You need your CWL to login. 

We look forward to hearing you!

Cheers,
