Graduate Writing Forums:
WRITING GRANT APPLICATIONS

Small Group Meeting. May 21, 2014.

Questions
=========

-What is important to include when outlining the proposed research?
-What are the "weights" of importance for each section? How might those differ depending on the scholarship? This would be useful when having to include multiple aspects (leadership, research, etc.) into a confined space.
-How can we make the research proposal readable by someone outside of the discipline, while still making it relevant to someone inside the discipline?
-What are some common pitfalls in a grant application?
-What are some things that really shine on an application?
-What should be focussed on in a project proposal -- the methodology or application? Or something else?
-Publications: should working papers be included?
-What "relevant activities" besides research are important in a grant application?
